Technology companies need a strong sales support team to develop good products with right set of value propositions. Effective on-boarding of sales support requires a significant face to face training/interface, and requires a critical mass to support this training. This is normally not an issue if we have sufficient resources to provide this training. However, we are very tight on resources, and the push to replace resources lost in Des Plaines with people at HGR offices is placing a significant strain on the current resources (not enough resources to train, and takes much longer for an effective on-boarding) while lowering morale for everyone involved. Either we add more resources to allow sufficient on-boarding training, or replace lost resources in the same office to reduce strain on resources needed for training/on-boarding.
